2. **Bus Assignment**: Select city, route, and bus number
3. **GPS Tracking**: Real-time location updates sent to Firebase
4. **Alerts**: Send traffic, break, or emergency alerts
5. **Passenger Count**: Update current passenger count

#### User App (`user-app.html`):
1. **Route Selection**: Choose city and route to track
2. **Live Updates**: See real-time bus locations and speeds
3. **Bus Details**: Click on buses for detailed information
4. **Alerts**: Receive notifications about route disruptions
5. **Location**: Get current location and find nearby buses

#### Admin Dashboard (`admin-dashboard.html`):
1. **System Overview**: See active buses, drivers, and alerts
2. **Map View**: Real-time visualization of all buses
3. **Alert Management**: Handle emergency and traffic alerts
4. **Statistics**: System usage and performance metrics

### 5. Database Structure

```
firebase-database/
â”œâ”€â”€ live_buses/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ {routeId}/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ {driverId}/
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ busNumber: "PB-01-1234"
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ latitude: 30.7352
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ longitude: 76.778
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ speed: 25
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ isActive: true
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ passengerCount: 15

â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ busNumber: "PB-01-1234"
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ routeId: "ch1"
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ timestamp: 1640995200000

â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ phone: "+919876543210"
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ license: "PB-DL-2020-001234"
â””â”€â”€ routes/
    â””â”€â”€ {cityId}/
        â””â”€â”€ [route objects...]
```

### 6. Security Rules

The Firebase security rules ensure:
- âœ… Only authenticated users can read/write data
- âœ… Drivers can only update their own bus data
- âœ… Public read access for live bus tracking
- âœ… Admin-only access for sensitive operations

### 7. Testing the System

#### Demo Credentials:
**Driver Login:**
- Phone: `+919876543210`
- Driver ID: `DR001`

**Admin Login:**
- Email: `admin@demo.com`
- Password: `admin123`

#### Test Workflow:
1. Open `driver-app.html` and log in as driver
2. Assign a bus and start GPS tracking
3. Open `user-app.html` and track the same route
4. You should see the bus moving in real-time!

### 8. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

**Connection Problems:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Firebase project credentials in `config.js`
- Ensure Firebase Database is enabled in console

**GPS Not Working:**
- Allow location permissions in browser
- Test on HTTPS (required for GPS in modern browsers)
- Check browser console for errors

**Data Not Updating:**
- Verify Firebase security rules are set correctly
- Check browser console for Firebase errors
- Test connection using the setup tool

#### Getting Help:
1. Use the Firebase Setup tool to test connectivity
2. Check browser console for detailed error messages
3. Verify all files are loaded correctly (no 404 errors)

### 9. Production Deployment

Before going live:
1. âœ… Update Firebase security rules for production
2. âœ… Set up Firebase Authentication for driver login
3. âœ… Configure HTTPS for GPS functionality
4. âœ… Set up monitoring and logging
5. âœ… Test with real devices and GPS

### 10. Next Steps

Your Firebase integration is complete! You can now:
- Test the real-time tracking functionality
- Customize the UI and add more features
- Set up authentication for enhanced security
- Deploy to a web server for public access

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!

Your Punjab Transport Tracker now has a fully functional Firebase backend with real-time capabilities!
